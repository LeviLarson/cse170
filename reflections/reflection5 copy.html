    <h1>Week 6 Reflection</h1>
    <h3>Name: Levi Larson</h3>

    <h2>"Why is this week's topic important for team work?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p>Sometimes we all face certain amounts of pressure, we make mistakes. The most important part is how we respond to mistakes in teh workspace. If we don't take responsibility for our own mistakes, or over react to mistakes others make, it could casue problems between team members and trust can start to dissolve. Although, when people consistently make mistakes and show no intent in improving, it lets you know that they are holding your team back and it could be in your best interest to let them know that they might be let go.</p>

    <h2>"If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week's topic to the gospel?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p>We all make mistakes, and just like in the workspacec, we show how sincere we are by our actions rather than our words. We can say sorry and try to imply that we want to apologize, but true repentance doesn't happen until we start to take action towards changing our bad habits and actually fixing and correcting our wrongs.
        </p>

    <h2>"How does your experience relate to other experiences you've had?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p>Working at country clubs and private land there were always these high work expectations to get a lot done. It didn't always have to be perfect, but a ot of the time my employers would be a little disappointed if we hadn't finished a task in the time that they had estimated. However, they were extremely grateful for the occasions when we finsihed before we were anticipated to. Seeing that helped me instill a mindset of working hard and fast, but it was definitely more interesting when I strated working other jobs where more precision was required of me. I learned to focus more on what I was doiung and was able to become a valuable piece of the other teams I was a part of.</p>

    <h2>"How do you plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p>I would like to build an idea where everyone is aware of their expectations and tries their hardest to keep them. It's also good to let them know that their is some leniency, but not to tht point where all of the rules can be bent.</p>

    <h2>"What would you do differently next week?" (10 points)</h2>
        <p>Next week I'd like to try to arrive 5 minutes early to my job, as that is what is expected. Sometimes it is a little difficult because i get out of my calss and like to relax a little before I go stragiht to work, but I think it might be better if I stay moving and eliminate my distractions so I can be a better employee.</p>

    <h2>"What is the most significant take-a-way you have gained from your study this week?" (10 points)</h2>
        <p>Mistakes happen in every professioanl environment, but they aren't the end of everything. Working to resolve them and keeping them to a minimum is something that is very crucial, but there isn't any need to cause a lot of extra stress in your life because you made a simple mistake.</p>

    <h2>Points: 100</h2>

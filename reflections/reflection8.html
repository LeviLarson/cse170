    <h1>Week 8 Reflection</h1>
    <h3>Name: Levi Larson</h3>

    <h2>"Why is this week's topic important for team work?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p>Identifying and resolving conflict is somethign that keeps morale and ethics high. Sometimes conflict helps us identify our flaws and grow individually an as a team, when mistreated and resolved poorly it can cause serious repercussions in the work area.</p>
    <h2>"If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week's topic to the gospel?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p>Sometimes we are presented with conflicting ideas and beliefs in our life, but we should also remember everyone has their own agency. Everyone chooses what path they want to follow, and sometimes that path is completely opposite from our own. This does not exempt us from being respectful and caring to these people, but gives us more room to grow into better disciples of Jesus Christ.</p>
    <h2>"How does your experience relate to other experiences you've had?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p>When I was serving my mission I definitely had some conflict between companions, and not that it was necessarily a hostile enviroment, we just had a difference in values and opinions. After working with a lot of missionaries that weren't completely motivated to work hard and do good, it was always refreshing to be with someone who was willing to work hard and get a lot done. Although without having realised it completely, I had picked up some not so good habits after working with them. The conflic tand difference in ideas helped me grow to become a better person.</p>
    <h2>"How do you plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p></p>
    <h2>"What would you do differently next week?" (10 points)</h2>
        <p>This week I will try to resolve some kind of conflict. I can't grow or improve if I stay in a comfortable position all the time. </p>
    <h2>"What is the most significant take-a-way you have gained from your study this week?" (10 points)</h2>
        <p>Conflict can always be used for something better. Just placing the blame on someone doesn't help anyone, even if you place it on yourself. Spometimes you just have to accept that a mistake was made, learn from it, and move on.</p>

    <h2>Points: 100</h2>

    <h1>Week 7 Reflection</h1>
    <h3>Name: Levi Larson</h3>

    <h2>"Why is this week's topic important for team work?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p>Commitment is a very importantn topic related to temamwork because it shows how much you value your work and teammates and builds strong relationships and networks between you an dyour colleauges. It makes you seem more profressional and can show that you truly value you job and are an honest and trustworthy employee.</p>
    <h2>"If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week's topic to the gospel?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p>We have to be willing to commit to the Lord just as we might have to commit to our jobs and projects. That means sometimes we might be faced with some hard decisions, and the decision will have to be a no sometimes, even though it might hurt us. Having the integrity to stand up for what you believe in an dknow you can do is something that a lot of people will have respect for, and in turn can lead to more respect for your beliefs. Sometimes we do need to push ourselves though, but it should never come with the rsik of loosing the thiungs that are most important to us, such as our family or spiritually edifying activities such as sacrament or temple attendence.</p>
    <h2>"How does your experience relate to other experiences you've had?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p>I've had instances where friends have invited me to do something in plac eof something that I have regularly planned, and honestly it was a little hard at first to tell them no, but after recognizing that they understood and respected me enough to see why I was doing what I was, it made me realize that I always have an option to say no and avoid those things that I might not want to do and do the things that are important and pertinent to my well-being.</p>
    <h2>"How do you plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p>This week I want to help contribute to my team by keeping our goals and plans realistic and acheivable (SMART Goals you could say), in an effort to be able to stretch ourselves enough to grow and learn more, but not fall victim to a large amount of pressure or stress. Once this is done, we can refkec ton things we can improve on for our other projects and become better and more fluid as a team so we can continue to grow together</p>
    <h2>"What would you do differently next week?" (10 points)</h2>
        <p>This week I'll try saying no to some things. Often times my friends ask me to hang out when I have assignments I need to do or I distract myself on social media instead of reading my scriptures. I think that getting more comfortable with saying no is something that can help me not only this week but in the future as well.</p>
    <h2>"What is the most significant take-a-way you have gained from your study this week?" (10 points)</h2>
        <p>We won't know all of the estimates to the projects we work on. Sometimes we'll be way ahead of schedule, but other tiems we can fall behind pretty hard and be struggling to catch-up. Something important to do is not be too prideful and try to approach things in a more humble manner so we can set truly realistic goals and objectives for ourselves.</p>

    <h2>Points: 100</h2>

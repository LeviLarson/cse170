    <h1>Week 3 Reflection</h1>
    <h3>Name: Levi Larson</h3>

    <h2>"Why is this week's topic important for team work?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p>     Being aware of our personalities can help us work in a team setting by allowing us to know and understand the strengths and weaknesses of all of our teammates. Knowing these things isn't just to weed out the week or incompatible, but to figure out how the team can become more united and work together seamlessly. The increase in production would bring a major advantage to whoever they're working for.
        </p>
    <h2>"If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week's topic to the gospel?" (20 points)</h2>
         <p>    Just as everyone has different personalities, everyone has different talents that they've had for an eternity. These personalities and talents are something that we should be learning about and developing here on this earth now, especially now that we have bodies. This is teh reason we came here and experience mortality. However, there were some of our spirit brothers and sisters who might not have made the best choice and decided to follow Satan in the War in Heaven. We've been entrusted with a special gift, the gift of agency, and as long as we use that correctly we can continue to develop our talents and personalities until they are in likeness unto our Heavenly Father's.
         </p>
    <h2>"How does your experience relate to other expereinces you've had?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p>     I've come accross many people that simply haven't had the right attitude about certian things. That somethimg was too hard, or maybe it was too easy. I've noticed that as long as I can mantain a positive, or at least calm and controlled attitude, I can do things that maybe I thought I couldn't before hand. This is mainly becuas eof my personality, and I understand that others might have different personalities, but through building a friendship with them I've noticed that I can help them draw out the better parts of their personalities and help them become a better version of theirselves.
        </p>
    <h2>"How do you plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p>     I think asking for feedback is something that will not only benefit my team, but also myself, and also any other team that I could be in the future. The feedabck will help me realize what I could improve as a team member, and as I work out those kinks I can help the workflow increase and become a more trustworthy and reliable team member.
        </p>
    <h2>"What would you do differently next week?" (10 points)</h2>
        <p>     Next week I could definitely work on improving the weaker aspects of my personlity. I can push myself a little outside of my comfort zone and into a learning zone. This self-development is honestly something that should be practiced daily. They don't have to be super big things either. They could be reading more of my scriptures, take a little time out of my day to compliment someone, etc. Its generally the small and simple things that do and mean the most.
        </p>
    <h2>"What is the most significant take-a-way you have gained from your study this week?" (10 points)</h2>
        <p>     My personality can be one of my biggest strengths in the workforce. It's really what takes a hold of a lot of my soft skills. And my personality is also subject to have change throughout my whole life. I should always be ready and available to adapt and strengthen all of my skills.
        </p>
    <h2>Points: 100</h2>
    <p>I answered four 20 point questions and two 10 point questions with adaquete depth and reasoning for a total of 100 points. </p>

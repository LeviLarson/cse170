    <h1>Week 3 Reflection</h1>
    <h3>Name: Levi Larson</h3>

    <h2>"Why is this week's topic important for team work?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p>This week's topic of motivaton was particularly important to teamwork becuase if a team isn't motviated to work on a task, then it will hold them back severely. Even if one person isn't motivated, they play an important piece in the team and their lack of productivity can set a whole project back and make a company look bad as a whole. Take Mr. Porter's situation for example. He is extremely unmotivated and is extremely relaxed in all of his tasks and duties. he's starting to make the company look bad and not only will he face the reprecussions, but his colleagues will some as will.</p>

    <h2>"If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week's topic to the gospel?" (20 points)</h2>
         <p>Our discipline in following the commandments of God is what will ultimately lead to hapiness in this life. If we keep to the covenant path, God will give us an abundance of blessings and we will truly feel happiness, not just some spike of dopamine that we would get from indulging ourselves in worldly pleasures.</p>

    <h2>"How does your experience relate to other expereinces you've had?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p>I've seen that my discipline and self-motivation have helped me become something better than what the world would be able to offer. I've had friends that didn't really have goals and just wanted to involve themselves in activities that didn't provide any actual growth, whether it be spiritual, mental, physical, or even fiscal. I'm extremely grateful for my parents and the morals that they raised me with that have given me in an independent state of thinking that isn't swayed by simple opposition.</p>

    <h2>"How do you plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p>I would like to contribute to the team by sharing my ideas ina  motivating and interactive sense. It would be nice to invite everyone to share their ideas and strengths. When people feel free to be who they are and contribute to something they feel a part of, they'll definitely be more motivated to work hard and put their heart into it.</p>    

    <h2>"What would you do differently next week?" (10 points)</h2>
        <p>This week I want to try and motivate more people around me. I'll start by helping my roommate feel more motivated to work on his homework, since he usually feels stressed and distracted when he has to start working on it.</p>    

    <h2>"What is the most significant take-a-way you have gained from your study this week?" (10 points)</h2>
        <p>Sometimes we're stuck in hard situations, and we have to stick them out. Sometimes we try our hardest to ahve a certain outcome, but we end up with another. When this happens, we sometimes build this sense of pride and say to ourselves, "It should have been me," or "It should have happened this way," but in reality we need to loose our sense of entitlement and move on. The more we sit around wishing it would have turned out better, we loose time trying to make it work out the nex time.</p>    

    <h2>Points: 100</h2>

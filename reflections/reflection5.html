    <h1>Week 5 Reflection</h1>
    <h3>Name: Levi Larson</h3>

    <h2>"Why is this week's topic important for team work?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p>Professionalism is what will keep the workplace a calm and enjoyable enviroment. If everyone just did what they wanted, the team, or even the company could be a related to an anarchism. Peofessioanlism is what holds together some key morals and values in a workplace and it keeps everyone on the same terms. It helps eliminate gossip and malcontent by setting astandard that everyone is required to follow. It also helps you get hired by showing your compatibility, and in some cases for others, lose their job for showing the opposite.</p>

    <h2>"If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week's topic to the gospel?" (20 points)</h2>
         <p>WE show others our beliefs and standards through our actions, not our words. If I were to say I was a hard working individual, I must be willing to show that to those around me. The same applies to our gospel beliefs. While we aren't perfect at everything we do, we should definitely strive to show others that we are disciples of Christ by living the principles and laws he set for us.</p>

    <h2>"How does your experience relate to other expereinces you've had?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p>I've often had people comment on my work ethics and professionalism in the work place. In turn for being profressional, I recieved more training opportunities and favor of my employers and leaders. I earned their trust, so they were able to trust me with more tasks.</p>

    <h2>"How do you plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p>I want to improve the professional atmosphere around me by being an example of what I think it should be, seeing how others are professioanl, and taking those best aspects and putting them into practice. Doing this should hel;p others ee the importance of this team dynamic that is reliant on a professioanl atmosphere.</p>    

    <h2>"What would you do differently next week?" (10 points)</h2>
        <p>This next week I want to try and put more attention in class and take more notes. I think that's something that I am lacking and it will help prepare me for te futitre when I need to take notes in meetings and put my attention towards the subjects being discussed in them.</p>    

    <h2>"What is the most significant take-a-way you have gained from your study this week?" (10 points)</h2>
        <p>Be aware that everything you do will have some consequence on the way people percieve you. As long as your trying hard and learning to be better, people will see that and you will develop a good reputation, but if you are too relaxed and don't prioritize the important things in the workplace your reputation as an employee can fall quickly.</p>    

    <h2>Points: 100</h2>

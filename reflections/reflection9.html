    <h1>Week 9 Reflection</h1>
    <h3>Name: Levi Larson</h3>

    <h2>"Why is this week's topic important for team work?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p>Competition was an important topic because it helps us be aware of it's effects and the need to keep it very balanced and under control in the workplace. If there isn't enough of it, we might not be as productive as we can be and people might start dreading their job. If there's too much competition then it could cause divides in the workplace and ruin the teamwork that was previously built.</p>
    <h2>"If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week's topic to the gospel?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p>Often times we can have fun with a little competition, but we have to remember that we are all headed to the same place when we are working as a team, much like how we should work as a team to bring forth the salvation of mankind. Nobody is going to take first and win it all, it's a team effort that requires us to work together to help people come unto Christ and feel his love and recieve the blessings that they need.</p>
    <h2>"How does your experience relate to other experiences you've had?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p>Competiton is something that has always driven me to have more fun and involve myself more in what I'm doing. There have been times when I've worked with people who maybe didn't wan tto involve themselves and tried to avoid the competition and exclue themselves. When I tried convincing them to try and enjoy themselves by thinking less about the light-hearted competition, they ended up having a lot more fun then before.</p>
    <h2>"How do you plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p>I'd like to add some sort of useful competition that I could involve in the team. This should let us to have a little more fun and enjoy ourselves more as we are acheiving and completing our goals and tasks</p>
    <h2>"What would you do differently next week?" (10 points)</h2>
        <p>Try not to create overly competitive scebarios. Sometimes the guys I work out with end up lifting too heavy and loose form, or people get really aggressive on games I play, so by creating the right atmosphere and amount of competition I can make anyhting I do with others a little more enjoyable.</p>
    <h2>"What is the most significant take-a-way you have gained from your study this week?" (10 points)</h2>
        <p>Competition can be something good, but it has to be monitored quickly. It usually changes to something bad when people loose the team vision and start focusing on their own agendas and pushing them onto others. By keeping everyone in mind and being realistic about our goals and milestones, we can create a responsible and controllable amount of competition.</p>

    <h2>Points: 100</h2>

    <h1>Week 2 Reflection</h1>
    <h2>"Why is this week's topic important for team work?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p>     Going over the importance of the strength of influence made me reflect on my own influence and how I need to shape and mold 
            it. My influence will be shed upon everyone I cross, so when it comes to working with a team, all of the team members influences
            will mix and be shared. The outcome of this mixture will provide the success of the team. If the team membres have a weak or
            even negative influences on each other, then they ar eworking against each other and hinder the progress of the task at hand. 
            Positive influences will bring energy to a team and establish the relationships needed to work effecrively.
         </p>
    <h2>"If this was a religion class, how would you relate this week's topic to the gospel?" (20 points)</h2>
         <p>    Our influence upon others means everything. As disciples of Christ, our goal is to become just as he is. By following
             the Master Teacher's example we will develop some of his attributes and and use those to share his blessings to all that
             surround us. Christ's influence is meant for anyone and everyone.
         </p>
    <h2>"How does your experience relate to other expereinces you've had?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p>     All of our biggest role modles influence us to a certain degree. They influence us to understand what good and bad means, 
            our work ethic, and evebn what our understanding of life is. I've definitely had the privelege to grow up with friends and
            family that have all been a positive influence on me, and as I've matured and become more independent, I can definitely
            notice the differecnce in conduct between myself and others who haven't had such great role modles in their life. While others
            may not have had that opportunity, they can always try to make the changes that they need in their life to become a better
            influence for others.
        </p>
    <h2>"How do you plan on contributing to the team, besides completing your tasks?" (20 points)</h2>
        <p>     I'd like to help my team and contribute by making sure I have a profressional and positive influence on my team members. 
            This includes many simple and subtle things such as being on time to meetings, responding quickly and correctly, being positive 
            overall, and especially being inclusive and humble. Nobody works very well with control hogs, if we're meant to work as a team
            then tha's the way it ought to be.
        </p>
    <h2>"What would you do differently next week?" (10 points)</h2>
        <p>Next week I'd like to try and apply my teamwork skills more. I've met quite a few people and now I'd like to actually try working
            with them now that I know we have some similar classes. I'll try to work on homework with a few of them and we can solve 
            difficult problems together. I think this will really beefit me and push me to work a little harder as well.
        </p>
    <h2>"What is the most significant take-a-way you have gained from your study this week?" (10 points)</h2>
        <p>     The most important take-a-way I gained this week was that my influence as a disciple of Christ can intrigue someone enough
            to help them become converetd to the gosple. We truly carry a light with us that is different form any other.
        </p>
